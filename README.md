Car Parking Micro Service
---
1. When the car comes in, check if there is a space and allocate space if available, otherwise give message saying full.   Let us assume the car park size is 100.
2. When the car leaves, calculate the time spent and charge £2 per hour.  We don’t need the payment module but just returning the amount is enough.
3. Handle multiple cars coming at the same time.
